# Reinforcement Learning: Deeq Q Learning Network (DQN) Agent playing Atari Breakout

* This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) for playing Atari's Breakout using TensorFlow. The project is designed to demonstrate how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to solve classic arcade games.
  

## Environment Setup
Ensure your environment is properly configured with the following dependencies:
* Python 3.10.10 
* OpenAI Gymnasium: v0.28.1
* Atari Environment: BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4
* Tensorflow V.2.10.0


## Implementation
* Deep Q Learning Network with the following improvements:
	- Experience Replay: Storing past experiences to break the correlation between consecutive samples.
	- Fixed Target Q-Network: Stabilizing learning by using a separate target network for Q-value updates.
	- TD error loss function with: Optimized using the formula
		 *Q<sub>target</sub> = reward + (1-terminal) * (gamma * Q<sub>max</sub>(sâ€™)


## Project Structure
* my_breakout_dqn.py: Script to train the DQN agent.
* my_breakout_dqn_eval.py: Script to test and evaluate the trained DQN agent.
